# Here is a bunch of stuff...

# Simple Tower Defense Game

---

## Overview

This project is a dynamic tower defense game built using Python and Pygame, incorporating advanced game mechanics and interactive features. The game includes:

- **Fully Functional Game Loop**: A robust main loop that handles game updates, rendering, and events such as input handling and quitting.
- **Dynamic Difficulty System**: Integrated difficulty adjustment using a slider, allowing players to select between Easy, Medium, and Hard modes, each with distinct spawn rates, enemy speeds, and progression curves.
- **Enemy and Tower Logic**: Enemies follow a randomized path with varying speed and spawn rates based on difficulty. Towers (Light and Heavy) have distinct properties and prioritize enemies based on proximity and type.
- **Responsive UI**: A responsive ribbon UI that displays the current score, selected tower type, number of enemies, and tower count, with additional messages and real-time updates during gameplay.
- **Custom Path Generation**: Enemies traverse a randomly generated path with the start and end fixed, introducing variability to each game session.
- **Advanced Debugging and Logging**: Real-time logging for monitoring enemy movements, tower firing behavior, and game state updates for easier debugging and analysis.

This update reflects the richer features and functionality you've added, emphasizing the dynamic aspects of your game, particularly the difficulty adjustment, randomized path, and enhanced game mechanics.

```

## Current State

The game currently:
- Initializes a Pygame window with a dynamic UI, including a ribbon for displaying score, tower information, and difficulty settings.
- Runs a main game loop that manages gameplay, user input, and event handling, with real-time updates to the game state, including towers, enemies, and the player's score.
- Implements a dynamic difficulty system using a slider that adjusts enemy spawn rates and speeds based on the selected level (Easy, Medium, Hard).
- Features a path system with randomly generated waypoints that always start on the left side and end on the right side, providing varied routes for enemies.
- Includes fully functioning towers and enemies with enhanced logic for range detection, shooting prioritization, and health management.
- Logs key events, errors, and detailed debug information to both the console and a log file (`tower_defense.log`), allowing for in-depth troubleshooting and performance monitoring.
- Provides modular and organized code for better scalability, with separate modules for game state management, user input, UI handling, and game objects like towers, enemies, and paths.
## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.12 or higher.
- Pygame (installation instructions below).

### Setting Up the Project

- I don't have a repo to clone for just this...  yet...


1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd tower_defense
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   If you're inside the virtual environment, the requirements file:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Game**:
   Once everything is installed, run the game:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

   This will open the Pygame window and start the basic game loop.

## Logging

The game uses Python's built-in `logging` module to log important information to both the console and a log file (`tower_defense.log`). These logs include:
- Initialization events (e.g., Pygame startup and game window creation).
- Debug messages from the game loop (e.g., frame rate capping, screen updates).
- Error messages if any exceptions occur during runtime.

## Future Development

This is an early-stage version of the tower defense game. Future iterations will include:
- Implementing enemies that move along the path.
- Allowing the player to place towers to shoot at the enemies.
- Adding waves of enemies with increasing difficulty.
- Introducing a user interface for resources, health, and other game stats.

## Contribution

# Getting started with Pygame developing  
### Step-by-Step Guide to Setting Up a Virtual Environment:

1. **Navigate to Your Project Directory**
   - Use the terminal/command prompt to navigate to your project directory (`tower_defense` in this case).
   ```bash
   cd HomeLab/Python/projects/games/tower_defense
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**
   - In your project directory, create a virtual environment by running:
```zsh
   python3 -m venv venv
```
   - This will create a folder called `venv` (you can name it anything, but `venv` is common) that contains the isolated Python installation.

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**
   - The command to activate the virtual environment depends on your operating system:

	 - **macOS/Linux**:
  ```zsh
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

   - Once activated, your terminal prompt will change to indicate that you are now working inside the virtual environment (e.g., `(venv)` will appear before the command prompt).

4. **Install `pygame` in the Virtual Environment**
   - With the virtual environment activated, install `pygame`:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

5. **Documenting the Installed Packages**
   - After installing all the required packages, you can create a `requirements.txt` file, which documents your dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip freeze > requirements.txt
   ```
   - This will create a `requirements.txt` file listing all the packages installed in your virtual environment, making it easy for others (or yourself) to recreate the same environment later.

6. **Deactivating the Virtual Environment**
   - When you're done working on the project, you can deactivate the virtual environment and return to your global Python environment by running:
   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```
